This my Initial Set-Up with the dynamic window manager by suckless which follows that whole suckless 
philospy of Keeping code simple and under 2000 lines.

I have not customise my Set-Up just changed the wallpaper of my choice, changed some colors for wallpaper theme and changed the statusbar to show necessary details and nothing fancy as I like to keep it minimal and straight forward to use.
Couple of things is what I added are Support for volume keys and for that I have used amixer and not pulse audio. I have also added support for print keys by using scrot so whenever you will hit the print button on your keyboard it will take screenshot.

Other than that I have created a simple dwmbar script that you can put in your .xprofile Or .xinitrc.

Another thing is that I use Siji fonts not Fontawesome because it keeps sucking while I try Any different font with It So, In all my statusbar scripts not just for dwmbar but for my polybar scripts too I use Siji fonts which is available in AUR. 
You can also check for It's availability as per as your distribution.
