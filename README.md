# Dynamic Window Manager (alias dwm)
This my Initial Set-Up with the dynamic window manager by suckless which follows that whole suckless 
philospy of Keeping code simple and under 2000 lines. I have'nt customise my Set-Up just changed the wallpaper of my choice, changed some colors for wallpaper theme and changed the statusbar to show necessary details and nothing fancy as I like to keep it minimal and straight forward to use.
Couple of things is what I added are Support for volume keys and for that I have used amixer and not pulse audio. I have also added support for print keys by using scrot so whenever you will hit the print button on your keyboard it will take screenshot. 
Other than that I have a dwmbar script that you can put in your.xprofile Or.xinitrc.
