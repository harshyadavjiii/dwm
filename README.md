# My dwm Set-Up
This my Initial Set-Up with the dynamic window manager by suckless which follows that whole suckless 
philospy of Keeping code simple and under 2000 lines. I have'nt customise my Set-Up just changed the wallpaper of my choice, changed some colors for wallpaper theme and changed the statusbar to show necessary details and nothing fancy as I like to keep it minimal and straight forward to use.
